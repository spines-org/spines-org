NAME
       spines_accept - Accepts a connection on a Spines socket 


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_accept(int s, struct sockaddr *addr, 
                         socklen_t *addrlen);

    

DESCRIPTION
       The accept function is used with connection-based socket types
       (SOCK_STREAM). It extracts the first connection request on the
       queue of pending connections, creates a new connected socket
       with mostly the same properties as s, and allocates a new file
       descriptor for the socket, which is returned. The newly created
       socket is no longer in the listening state. The original socket
       s is unaffected by this call.

       The argument s is a socket that has been created with
       spines_socket, bound to a local address with spines_bind, and
       is listening for connec- tions after a spines_listen.

       The argument addr is a pointer to a sockaddr structure. This
       struc- ture is filled in with the address of the connecting
       entity, as known to the communications layer. The addrlen
       argument is a value-result parameter: it should initially
       contain the size of the structure pointed to by addr; on return
       it will contain the actual length (in bytes) of the address
       returned.  When addr is NULL nothing is filled in.

       If no pending connections are present on the queue, accept
       blocks the caller until a connection is present.

       In order to be notified of incoming connections on a socket,
       you can use select or poll. A readable event will be delivered
       when a new connection is attempted and you may then call accept
       to get a socket for that connection.



RETURN VALUE
       The call returns -1 on error. If it succeeds, it returns a
       non-negative integer that is a descriptor for the accepted
       socket.
