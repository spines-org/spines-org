NAME
       spines_setsockopt - Sets the options for a Spines socket


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_setsockopt(int s, int level, int optname, 
                             const void *optval, socklen_t optlen);


DESCRIPTION

       The spines_setsockopt call is currently used for controlling
       multicast and anycast communication. The parameter s refers to the
       socket connected to Spines, and has to be of type SOCK_DGRAM. The
       rest of the parameters will depend on optname:

       SPINES_ADD_MEMBERSHIP 
           Joins a multicast or anycast group. The optval and
           optlen should refer to the ip_mreq struct containing the
           multicast/anycast group.

       SPINES_DROP_MEMBERSHIP 
           Leaves a multicast or anycast group. The optval and
           optlen should refer to the ip_mreq struct containing the
           multicast/anycast group.

       SPINES_MULTICAST_LOOP 
           Turns on/off the multicast loopback. The optval and optlen
           should refer to a u_char boolean parameter where 0=off and 1=on

       SPINES_SET_PRIORITY
           Sets the priority level that will be assigned to all future messages
           using the BEST_EFFORT_FLOOD_ROUTING dissemination protocol. Valid
           priority levels are between 1 and 10 (inclusive), where 10 is the
           highest priority.

       SPINES_SET_EXPIRATION
           Sets the expiration time for all future messages using the
           BEST_EFFORT_FLOOD_ROUTING dissemination protocol. Meta data for 
           messages are stored at spines daemons until they expire in order
           to prevent message replay attacks from potentially malicious
           neighbors.

       SPINES_DISJOINT_PATHS
           Sets the number of node-disjoint paths to use for all
           future messages using SOURCE_BASED_ROUTING,
           IT_PRIORITY_ROUTING, or IT_RELIABLE_ROUTING. Spines
           currently supports values between 0 and 6 (inclusive). A
           value of 0 represents flooding on the overlay, values 1-5
           (inclusive) represent 1 to 5 node-disjoint paths, and 6
           represents dissemination graphs with targeted redundancy.

           The dissemination-graph scheme uses two disjoint paths in
           the normal case, but if problems are detected (using
           "problem" type routing) at a source or destination, the
           protocol switches to a dissemination graph that adds
           targeted redundancy around the problematic source and/or
           destination.

       Spines multicast address space is from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
       (Class D address). Spines anycast address space is from 240.0.0.0 to
       254.255.255.255 (Class E address).


RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.
