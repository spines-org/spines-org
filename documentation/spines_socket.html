NAME 
       spines_socket - create an endpoint for communication with Spines


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_socket(int domain, int type, int protocol,
			 const struct sockaddr *serv_addr);

DESCRIPTION 
       spines_socket creates an endpoint for communication and returns
       a descriptor.

       The domain parameter specifies a communication domain; this
       selects the protocol family which will be used for
       communication.  The currently understood formats include:

       Name		   Purpose
       PF_SPINES	   Regular Spines communication

       The socket has the indicated type, which specifies the
       communication semantics. Currently defined types are:

       SOCK_STREAM
              Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based
              byte streams.

       SOCK_DGRAM
              Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages
              of a fixed maximum length).

       The protocol specifies both the communication protocol between
       the client application and the Spines daemon, and the protocol
       used by the Spines daemons to forward messages initiated from
       this particular socket. The protocol is specified as a binary
       OR between two flags:

       Communication between the client application and the daemon:
       TCP_CONNECT
		   TCP communication

       UDP_CONNECT
		   UDP communication

       Message forwarding between the Spines daemons for this
       particular socket uses a link protocol and a dissemination
       protocol:

       Link Protocols:
       UDP_LINKS
		   Best effort forwarding

       RELIABLE_LINKS
		   Messages are sent reliably between daemons

       SOFT_REALTIME_LINKS
		   Message losses are attempted to be recovered, but
		   only if they are likely to be recovered within a
		   certain time frame

       INTRUSION_TOL_LINKS 
		   Messages are sent reliably between daemons and can be
	           cryptographically protected (configuration option).
		   The link provides protection against a potentially
		   compromised endpoint by forcing each packet
		   acknowledgement to contain evidence that the packet
	           was actually received. 

       Dissemination Protocols:
       MIN_WEIGHT_ROUTING:
	               Stateless routing protocol based on link-state routing

       SOURCE_BASED_ROUTING:
                   Source-based routing protocol. Each packet is
                   stamped with a bitmask specifying the links it
                   should be sent over (its dissemination graph) when
                   it is created at its source. Supported routing
                   schemes are: flooding, k node-disjoint paths, and
                   targeted-redundancy dissemination graphs (see
                   spines_setsockopt below).

       IT_PRIORITY_ROUTING:
                   Stateful intrusion-tolerant routing protocol based on
                   source-based routing, providing timeliness guarantees
                   and priority semantics independently for each active
                   source. Messages can be cryptographically protected
                   (configuration option).

       IT_RELIABLE_ROUTING:
                   Stateful intrusion-tolerant routing protocol based on
                   source-based routing, providing end-to-end reliable
                   message delivery, using back-pressure to stop new
                   messages from entering the network when buffers are
                   full, until existing messages are delivered. Messages
                   can be cryptographically protected (configuration
                   option).

       When using IT_RELIABLE_ROUTING, the client can specify to its connected
       Spines daemon the type of semantics to apply to its messages when
       sending to a destination (different Spines daemon) that is undergoing
       back-pressure, i.e., buffers for that destination are full:

       Session Semantics (for IT_RELIABLE_ROUTING):
       RELIABLE_STREAM_SESSION
                   These semantics are best suited for applications that desire
                   reliable in-order communication to a single destination.

                   Messages are sent reliably between the client and its
                   connected Spines daemon. If the flow buffer from this daemon
                   to the destination has room, the message is added and sent.
                   If the buffer is full, we store the message (for later use)
                   and block the entire session toward all destinations until
                   this flow has space for the stored message.

       RELIABLE_DGRAM_SESSION_NO_BACKPRESSURE
                   These semantics are best suited for applications that
                   simultaneously send to multiple Spines destinations that do
                   not want to be blocked when a destination's flow buffer
                   becomes full. The no back-pressure option is appropriate for
                   applications that do not need to know whether messages were
                   accepted (able to fit in the flow buffer) at their connected
                   Spines daemon.

                   Messages are sent reliably between the client and its
                   connected Spines daemon. If the flow buffer from this daemon
                   to the destination has room, the message is added and sent.
                   If the buffer is full, the message is silently dropped. Note
                   that no message is stored for later and no feedback is given
                   to the client. It is presumed that the client will handle
                   any consequences accordingly.
                   
                   NOTE: These semantics are currently experimental and may be
                   subject to change in future versions.

       RELIABLE_DGRAM_SESSION_WITH_BACKPRESSURE
                   These semantics are best suited for applications that
                   simultaneously send to multiple Spines destinations that do
                   not want to be blocked when a destination's flow buffer
                   becomes full. The back-pressure option is appropriate for
                   applications that need to know whether messages were
                   accepted (able to fit in the flow buffer) at their connected
                   Spines daemon.

                   Messages are sent reliably between the client and its
                   connected Spines daemon. Explicit feedback for each message
                   is given to the client. This indicates whether or not the
                   daemon had space in the (destination-specific) flow buffer
                   to accept a client's message. 
                   
                   NOTE: These semantics are currently experimental and not in
                   the open-source. Please contact us if you want to know more
                   details.

       By default, if the Protocol is set to zero, Spines will use TCP_CONNECT,
       UDP_LINKS, MIN_WEIGHT_ROUTING, and RELIABLE_STREAM_SESSION.

       Different sockets connected to the same or different Spines
       daemons can use different values for their protocol parameter.
       
       The location of the Spines daemon is denoted by serv_addr. Currently,
       clients can connect using two distinct families: AF_INET and AF_UNIX.
       If serv_addr points to a struct sockaddr_in, then AF_INET will be chosen
       and the client connects over TCP or UDP (depending on the other flags).
       If serv_addr points to a struct sockaddr_un (on Unix-based systems), then
       AF_UNIX will be chosen and the client connects using IPC.

       If serv_addr is set to NULL, then the address set by spines_init()
       is used (see spines_init description). If spines_init() was not
       called explicitly, then the default connection method is IPC on Unix-based
       machines and TCP (localhost on port 8100) on Windows-based machines.

RETURN VALUE
       -1 is returned if an error occurs; otherwise the return value
       is a descriptor referencing the socket.
