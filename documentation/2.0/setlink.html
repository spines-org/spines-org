NAME 
     setlink - The Spines monitor program


SYNOPSIS 

     setlink bandwidth (kbps) latency (ms) loss_rate (%) 
             burst_rate (%) source_ip destination_ip [port]

DESCRIPTION 

     setlink sets the virtual link characteristics in the Spines
     topology from a source to a destination. Note that virtual links
     in Spines can be made asymetrical i.e. the loss rate from node A
     to node B can be different than the loss rate from B to a,
     etc. If the intent is to create a symmetrical link, in order to
     set the same parameters in both directions, setlink needs to be
     run twice, one time for each direction of the link.

     Note that the spines program needs to be run with the "-m" option
     in order to accept commands from setlink.
 

OPTIONS 

    port: The port on which the Spines network is running (default
          8100).
