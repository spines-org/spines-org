Spines is a messaging infrastructure that allows multi-hop communication
(unicast and multicast), and deployment of virtual topologies on real
networks.  Spines instantiates a virtual router node on every
participating computer and creates virtual links between these
nodes. Packets are routed automatically in through the network
topology.  Many Spines topologies can coexist in the same physical
network, and even overlap on some of the nodes or links.
<p>
Client applications connect to one of the router nodes (usually the
closest) and send and receive messages from that node. Spines is
responsible to forward application messages towards the nodes that
have destination applications.  If multiple applications intend to
communicate using Spines, they must connect to nodes of the same
Spines network.
<p>
Spines runs a software daemon on each of the router nodes. The daemon
acts both as a router, forwarding packets toward other nodes, and as a
server, providing network services to client applications. Clients use
a library to connect to a Spines daemon and send and receive
messages. The API is almost identical to the Unix Socket interface.
Virtually any socket-based application can be easily adapted to work
with Spines. Spines API provides TCP and UDP-like functions with
similar semantics for both reliable, and best effort communication.
<p>
A client can communicate with a daemon either via TCP or UDP.  A
<I>spines_socket()</I> call returns a socket, which is actually a connection
to the daemon. The application can use that socket to bind, listen,
connect, send and receive, using Spines library calls
(e.g. <I>spines_send()</I> is the equivalent to the regular <I>send()</I> call,
<I>spines_recv()</I> is equivalent to <I>recv()</I>, etc.).
<p>
Each application can be uniquely identified in the topology by the
pair of IP address of the node it is connected to, and an identifier
at that node, which we call "virtual port". The virtual port of an
application is either assigned automatically by the server node upon
application connect, or it is set explicitly by the application in a
call similar to the Unix bind(). Both reliable and best effort
communication between two applications connected to the Spines network
are done using the IP address and the virtual port described above in
a way similar to TCP and UDP. Note that the virtual port of an
application is only defined in relationship with a Spines node, and is
not related to an operating system port of the computer the
application, or the daemon is running on.
<p>
A multicast group is defined as a class D multicast address. If an
application intends to join a group, it informs its server (router
node) about this with a spines_setsockopt() call. From there on, the
server will pass to the application the messages sent to that
group. Leaving a group follows a similar procedure. In order to
multicast a message to a group, an application simply sends the
message (through its server) to the multicast address representing the
group. The Spines network handles the routing of the multicast message
according to the current membership of the group the message is sent
to.  Applications can join, leave, send and receive messages to and
from multicast groups at any time. An application can join multiple
groups, thus it can be member of more than one group at the same
time. An application does not need to be a member of a group in order
to send messages to that group.
<p>
The current version of Spines was tested to run on Linux X86 computers and 
on Linksys WRT54G wireless routers.
