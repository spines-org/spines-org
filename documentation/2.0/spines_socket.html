NAME 
       spines_socket - create an endpoint for communication with Spines


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_socket(int domain, int type, int protocol,
			 const struct sockaddr *serv_addr);

DESCRIPTION 
       spines_socket creates an endpoint for communication and returns
       a descriptor.

       The domain parameter specifies a communication domain; this
       selects the protocol family which will be used for
       communication.  The currently understood formats include:

       Name		   Purpose
       PF_SPINES	   Regular Spines communication

       The socket has the indicated type, which specifies the
       communication semantics. Currently defined types are:

       SOCK_STREAM
              Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based
              byte streams.

       SOCK_DGRAM
              Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages
              of a fixed maximum length).

       The protocol specifies both the communication prototol between
       the client application and the Spines daemon, and the protocol
       used by the Spines daemons to forward messages initiated from
       this particular socket. The protocol is specified as a binary
       OR between two flags:

       Communication between the client application and the daemon:
       TCP_CONNECT
		   TCP communication

       UDP_CONNECT
		   UDP communication

       Message forwarding between the Spines daemons for this
       particular socket:
       UDP_LINKS
		   best effort forwarding

       RELIABLE_LINKS
		   messages are sent reliably between daemons

       SOFT_REALTIME_LINKS
		   message losses are attempted to be recovered, but
		   only if they are likely to be recovered within a
		   certain time frame

       By default, if the Protocol is set to zero, Spines will use
       TCP_CONNECT, and UDP_LINKS.

       Different sockets connected to the same or different Spines
       daemons can use different values for their protocol parameter.
       
       The location of the Spines daemon is denoted by serv_addr. If
       serv_addr is set to NULL, then the address set by spines_init()
       is used, or if spines_init() was not called, it is assumed to
       be the localhost on port 8100.

RETURN VALUE
       -1 is returned if an error occurs; otherwise the return value
       is a descriptor referencing the socket.
