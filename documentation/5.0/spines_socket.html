NAME 
       spines_socket - create an endpoint for communication with Spines


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_socket(int domain, int type, int protocol,
			 const struct sockaddr *serv_addr);

DESCRIPTION 
       spines_socket creates an endpoint for communication and returns
       a descriptor.

       The domain parameter specifies a communication domain; this
       selects the protocol family which will be used for
       communication.  The currently understood formats include:

       Name		   Purpose
       PF_SPINES	   Regular Spines communication

       The socket has the indicated type, which specifies the
       communication semantics. Currently defined types are:

       SOCK_STREAM
              Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based
              byte streams.

       SOCK_DGRAM
              Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages
              of a fixed maximum length).

       The protocol specifies both the communication prototol between
       the client application and the Spines daemon, and the protocol
       used by the Spines daemons to forward messages initiated from
       this particular socket. The protocol is specified as a binary
       OR between two flags:

       Communication between the client application and the daemon:
       TCP_CONNECT
		   TCP communication

       UDP_CONNECT
		   UDP communication

       Message forwarding between the Spines daemons for this
       particular socket uses a link protocol and a dissemination
       protocol:

       Link Protocols:
       UDP_LINKS
		   Best effort forwarding

       RELIABLE_LINKS
		   Messages are sent reliably between daemons

       SOFT_REALTIME_LINKS
		   Message losses are attempted to be recovered, but
		   only if they are likely to be recovered within a
		   certain time frame

       INTRUSION_TOL_LINKS 
		   Messages are sent reliably between daemons and can be
	           cryptographically protected (configuration option).
		   The link provides protection against a potentially
		   compromised endpoint by forcing each packet
		   acknowledgement to contain evidence that the packet
	           was actually received. 

       Dissemination Protocols:
       MIN_WEIGHT_ROUTING:
	           Stateless routing protocol based on link-state routing

       BEST_EFFORT_FLOOD_ROUTING:
                   Stateful intrusion-tolerant routing protocol based on
                   source-based routing, providing timeliness guarantees
                   and priority semantics independently for each active
                   source. Messages can be cryptographically protected
                   (configuration option).

       RELIABLE_FLOOD_ROUTING:
                   Stateful intrusion-tolerant routing protocol based on
                   source-based routing, providing end-to-end reliable
                   message delivery, using back-pressure to stop new
                   messages from entering the network when buffers are
                   full, until existing messages are delivered. Messages
                   can be cryptographically protected (configuration
                   option).

       By default, if the Protocol is set to zero, Spines will use
       TCP_CONNECT, and UDP_LINKS, and MIN_WEIGHT_ROUTING.

       Different sockets connected to the same or different Spines
       daemons can use different values for their protocol parameter.
       
       The location of the Spines daemon is denoted by serv_addr. If
       serv_addr is set to NULL, then the address set by spines_init()
       is used, or if spines_init() was not called, it is assumed to
       be the localhost on port 8100.

RETURN VALUE
       -1 is returned if an error occurs; otherwise the return value
       is a descriptor referencing the socket.
