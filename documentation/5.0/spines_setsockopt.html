NAME
       spines_setsockopt - Sets the options for a Spines socket


SYNOPSIS
       #include "spines_lib.h"

       int spines_setsockopt(int s, int level, int optname, 
                             const void *optval, socklen_t optlen);


DESCRIPTION

       The spines_setsockopt call is currently used for controlling
       multicast and anycast communication. The parameter s refers to the
       socket connected to Spines, and has to be of type SOCK_DGRAM. The
       rest of the parameters will depend on optname:

       SPINES_ADD_MEMBERSHIP 
           Joins a multicast or anycast group. The optval and
           optlen should refer to the ip_mreq struct containing the
           multicast/anycast group.

       SPINES_DROP_MEMBERSHIP 
           Leaves a multicast or anycast group. The optval and
           optlen should refer to the ip_mreq struct containing the
           multicast/anycast group.

       SPINES_MULTICAST_LOOP 
           Turns on/off the multicast loopback. The optval and optlen
           should refer to a u_char boolean parameter where 0=off and 1=on

       SPINES_SET_PRIORITY
           Sets the priority level that will be assigned to all future messages
           using the BEST_EFFORT_FLOOD_ROUTING dissemination protocol. Valid
           priority levels are between 1 and 10 (inclusive), where 10 is the
           highest priority.

       SPINES_SET_EXPIRATION
           Sets the expiration time for all future messages using the
           BEST_EFFORT_FLOOD_ROUTING dissemination protocol. Meta data for 
           messages are stored at spines daemons until they expire in order
           to prevent message replay attacks from potentially malicious
           neighbors.

       SPINES_DISJOINT_PATHS
           Sets the number of node-disjoint paths to use for all future
           messages using either BEST_EFFORT_FLOOD_ROUTING or 
           RELIABLE_FLOOD_ROUTING. Spines currently supports values between
           0 and 5 (inclusive), where 0 represents flooding on the overlay.

       Spines multicast address space is from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
       (Class D address). Spines anycast address space is from 240.0.0.0 to
       254.255.255.255 (Class E address).


RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.
